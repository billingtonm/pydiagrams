To generate 'AWS Icons' execute AWS_PlantUML.py

This will build PUML libraries required to use custom icons.

It requires the environment variable AWS_ICONS to specify where the AWS Icons are installed to.
eg:
    AWS_ICONS = d:\Software\plantuml\AWS-Architecture-Icons_PNG\AWS-Architecture-Icons_PNG_20191031

The Plant UML code libraries are written to the environment variable: PLANTUML_AWS    
eg:
    PLANTUML_AWS = D:\Software\plantuml\AWS-PlantUML-new\dist
